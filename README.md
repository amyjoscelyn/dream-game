# Dream Game
A choose-your-own-ending adventure template where your choices influence the story and the world.

This CSV-based app is a template for numerous types of interactive gaming, including adventure tales, mysteries, simple stories, and quizzes.

CHCSVParser easily extracts the pertinent data from the CSVs fed into it and creates usable content for gameplay.

Core Data persists choices and bookmarks where you are in the story every time you open the app back up.

Key aspects of this storytelling template:
* **Questions** tell the story
* **Choices** provide access to different branches of the story
* **Effects** occur when certain Choices are selected
* **Prerequisites** determine whether your character, the story, or the world should be affected by Effects

Multiple stories are currently in the works, to try out the different kinds of gameplay that are possible, as well as to explore the kinds of details that can be altered by Effects, including the multiple Core Data entities and UI.
