BEGINNING,Beginning,—,q0001,,,You walk into the woods.
q0001,,q0000,q0002,,,"They are peaceful, serene.  The leaves filter the sun and lend a dusty green atmosphere to your surroundings.  The trees are tall and wide and bristling with branches, mostly deciduous, although there are some spruces and pines mixed in."
q0002,,q0001,q0003,,,"The path you are following is little more than a dirt road, hidden behind a rocky outcropping in the back of your grandparent’s yard.  You’ve decided today that you want to see where it goes."
q0003,,q0002,q0004,,,"Your breath before you took the first step into the woods was shaky yet brave.  After five minutes on the path, however, stepping over raised roots and clods of dirt, you feel there’s nothing here you need to be scared of.  In fact, these woods are quite boring."
q0004,First decision,q0003,,,"c0004.0, c0004.1","Grandma was baking cookies.  They might even be coming out of the oven right now.  There’s still time to go back, before it gets too dark, while the path is still straightforward and true."
q0010,(Go back),,q0011,c0004.0,,"She said she was making your favorite.  By the time you get back to the house, they’ll probably be cool and good to eat!"
q0011,,q0010,END,,,What a fun afternoon adventure!  Maybe you can go back to the woods the next time you visit.
END,Ending,"q0011, q0123, q0154, q0252, q0263",—,,,THE END.
q0020,(Keep going),,q0021,c0004.1,,"You know she was only making those cookies to entice you to stay, even though she agreed to let you camp in the woods for the night.  She’s worried about nothing, you think.  The woods are fine.  All you need is to find a nice clearing, set up your tent, maybe build a little fire, and then return in the morning."
q0021,,q0020,q0022,,,"You continue on until you reach a fork.  A large tree blocks the path from continuing forward, which make this a traditional fork: the path continues on to the left and to the right."
q0022,,q0021,q0023,,,"Grandpa told you about this fork.  He said there are only a few in this part of the woods.  To the left, the path reaches a nice clearing and then the path continues on, where it eventually circles back and leads right back to this fork.  You wouldn’t get lost at all, as long as you mark the tree.  That way, upon your return, you can notice your mark and then turn back onto the path that led you here in the first place."
q0023,Second decision,q0022,,,"c0023.0, c0023.1","You look to the left.  The path is clear and if you squint you can almost see a break in the trees down the way.  Surety and safety lead to the left.  You look to the right.  In comparison, the path is smaller, less worn, and meanders so much you lose it after it rounds a few trees.  The left might be perfect for a camping trip, but the right would be perfect for a true adventure."
q0030,(Go left),,q0031,c0023.0,,"You follow the pathway.  The way is easy going, and before long you come upon the clearing."
q0031,,q0030,q0032,,,"The clearing is not as large as you expected, about as large as your room at home and practically round.  The ground, flat and clear, leaves enough space for your tent between the edge of the trees and a small ring of stones that looks to be an old firepit with a bucket of sand propped nearby for when its time to put the fire out.  A low trunk from a felled tree rests nearby."
q0032,,q0031,q0033,,,"Setting the picnic basket grandma carefully packed for you, you ease the tent bag off your shoulders and lean it against your legs, allowing yourself a moment of rest."
q0033,Third decision,q0032,,,"c0033.0, c0033.1","This clearing is just as grandpa promised, and would make a great place to camp.  As you look around, you notice a smaller path leading away the opposite way you came.  Even though you squint, you can’t follow where it goes for long.  This must the path that continues on, like grandpa said, that eventually leads back into this clearing.  Two choices make themselves apparent in your mind."
q0040,(Set up camp now),,q0041,c0033.0,,"You look up at the sky.  You can barely see where the sun is positioned through the trees—its pretty close to the horizon.  This part of the country gets dark pretty early.  It’s better to have your camp set up now, so that you don’t need to worry about doing it without the light."
q0041,,q0040,q0042,,,"First you pitch your tent, hammering the stakes deep into the loamy earth.  The smell of the soil wafts into your face.  You’ve helped pitch tents before, so this doesn’t take too long.  The fire will be another story.  You’ve never started one all by yourself."
q0042,,q0041,q0043,,,"You gather some firewood, dry wood littered on the forest floor.  You arrange the twigs and snapped branches carefully, just as grandpa told you how."
q0043,,q0042,q0044,,,"Taking the flint out of the picnic basket, you recall how grandpa taught you and start a fire (it takes a dozen tries, with a short break for your hands and a quick self-validation session, but you manage to light it before too much time has passed).  The fire is small, and you spend more time than you expected tending it with a thick branch."
q0044,,q0043,q0045,,,"By the time you’re satisfied with your little fire, the clearing is almost dark.  The last vestiges of the sunset is hidden by the leafy canopy overhead.  Just a small circle of sky is visible between the trees, and you can make out Venus shining through the clouds in the purpling sky."
q0045,"Third and a half decision, hungry for dinner",q0044,,,c0045.0,"Your stomach grumbles happily as you crouch beside the fire, warming your hands.  Good thing your dinner is packed!"
q0046,(dinnertime),,q0047,c0045.0,,"You open the picnic basket grandma packed for you and eat one of the sandwiches she wrapped so nicely in a waxy napkin.  There is an apple, but you figure you’ll save that and the other sandwich plus the hard boiled eggs for tomorrow.  She packed you a juice box, and you smile as you poke the straw into it and squeeze the sweet, tangy liquid into your mouth."
q0047,"Fourth decision, s’mores ingredients discovered",q0046,,,"c0047.0, c0047.1","Underneath the other foods, you spy a little baggie tucked into the corner.  Inside it contains a few marshmallows, some not-yet-broken graham crackers, and a small pile of chocolate wafers.  A little note is taped to the bag."
q0048.0,(read note),,q0049,c0047.0,,"It’s just a little message from your grandma: “Something sweet for the sweetest person I know. Love, Grammy”.  She added a little heart at the bottom."
q0048.1,(ignore note),,q0049,c0047.1,,"It’s probably just some stupid lovey note from your grandma.  Probably trying to tell you to give up camping and come back to the house, just like she tried to do with the cookies.  Why is she trying so hard to keep you from camping?  You don’t need that.  You crumple up the note and toss it over your shoulder."
q0049,Fifth decision,"q0048.0, q0049.1",,,"c0049.0, c0049.1","You turn your attention back to the bag of S’mores ingredients.  Raging fire (well, it’s more than smoldering, at least), some chocolate and those big puffy marshmallows…"
q0050.0,(camping treat),,q0051.0,c0049.0,,What’s better than this on your first camping trip alone?  Who cares if you’re only fifteen minutes away from your grandparent’s house?   This is what living is all about!
q0051.0,done with dinner,q0050.0,q0052,,,"The S’mores are sweet, as promised, and you eat your fill.  With a bit of a tummyache, you stand up and stretch, cleaning up your impromptu dinner and dessert back into the picnic basket."
q0050.1,(camping restraint),,q0051.1,c0049.1,,"After that sandwich, you’re more full than you thought.  Sweet note or no, you’re not feeling the S’mores tonight."
q0051.1,done with dinner,q0050.1,q0052,,,"You stand up and stretch, and with a sigh begin to clean up your impromptu dinner back into the picnic basket."
q0052,post-dinner,"q0051.0, q0051.1",q0053,,,"You tend to the fire as the night settles deeper into the sky.  Flickering shadows stretch out from the fire, and although you can feel the woods pressing in onto the clearing, you feel calm and surprisingly at peace here in the circle of light."
q0053,Sixth decision,q0052,,,"c0053.0, c0053.1","Your body aches slightly from the bout of walking earlier, but it’s not so bad that you want to go to bed right away.  You can sit out and enjoy the night a little longer.  Of course, if you go to sleep now, you might be more inclined to wake up early and explore while the day is still young."
q0060,(stay up),,q0061,c0053.1,,"The fire crackles warmly at your feet, warming your knees and shins.  Beyond the fire, you hear the sounds of the forest: trees creaking, owls hooting, the rustling of bushes where small animals are settling into their homes for the night.  The fire feels nice and warm, and lulls you peacefully."
q0061,,q0060,q0062,,,"The stars are dim, but sure to get brighter the longer you stay up.  You watch the shadows press ever closer towards you, like the clearing is being swaddled by a cozy blanket.  The forest breathes around you, and you find yourself breathing to the same tempo, your heart beating with the pulse of the living earth around you.  Allowing the fire to lose some of its body and light, you take the world in with your deep, calm breaths, and then look up again at the sky."
q0062,,q0061,q0063,,,"Now the stars stand out like crystal, brilliant jewels set into the velvet cloth of the sky.  The night seems all at once vast and encompassing yet safe and snug.  You feel yourself falling into the distance of the sky, mesmerized by those tiny pinpricks of light and the whole world of galaxies they represent."
q0063,,q0062,q0064,,,"By the time an unconsciously large yawn shakes you out of your reverie, the fire is just a few remaining glowing embers against the lush darkness of the woods.  You yawn again as you stand, feeling your limbs turn numb from cold.  You stretch until your body tingles as you get the blood pumping just enough to finish up the last tasks before you can go to bed."
q0064,,q0063,q0073,,,"From the picnic basket, you pull out a bottle of water to keep beside you while you sleep and the flashlight that’s tucked inside.  Setting those inside the tent next to the sleeping bag, you focus on making sure you left nothing out that would attract any animals while you sleep.  Seeing nothing you forgot, you pick up the picnic basket and set it into the back of the tent, so you won’t trip over it in the night."
q0070,(go to bed),,q0071,c0053.0,,"You take your time as you wander around the clearing, preparing your body for sleep after your long walk in the woods.  You hear some animal sounds coming at you from a distance: there are hooting owls out there, and the shifting of underbrush from the smaller creatures.  You’re sure there are larger ones out there too, but you try not to think of them because you don’t want to have nightmares tonight.  You remind yourself that your grandparents are not that far away, snug in their house.  You’re sure if it comes down to it that you’ll be able to find your way out of the woods without any problem."
q0071,,q0070,q0072,,,"The picnic basket is by your feet.  In the flickering light of the fire, you reach into the basket and pull out one of the water bottles tucked inside and the flashlight.  You look up towards the sky as you take a quick swig of the water and watch the dark leaves sway against the blue-black night.  You can just make out some stars with your fire-blind eyes, although they twinkle out of existence whenever you try to look right at them."
q0072,,q0071,q0073,,,"You take another sip of the water, and then twist the cap on firmly and tuck both the bottle and the flashlight into the tent beside the entrance.  The picnic basket goes further inside the tent so you don’t have to worry about tripping over it in a state of half-sleep."
q0073,last-minute bedtime preparations,"q0064, q0072",q0074,,,"After a few more minutes of other bed-preparation activities, you’re finally ready to tuck in for the night.  You throw the sand over the remains of your low-burning fire until it flickers out of existence."
q0074,,q0073,q0075,,,"You set the bucket back beside the stones in the sudden darkness.  More out of sensation than sight you stumble over to the tent, stifling a jaw-cracking yawn.  You let yourself into the tent and tug on the zipper until the entrance closes tight."
q0075,inside sleeping bag at last,q0074,q0076,,,"Without further ado, you wriggle sleepily into your sleeping bag, fluff your pillow, and close your eyes to fall asleep."
q0076,Seventh decision,q0075,,,"c0076.0, c0076.1","It’s very quiet, now that you’re inside the tent and the fire is out.  The darkness presses against your eyes, even when they’re open.  You snuggle deeper into your sleeping bag.  Was that a wolf howling?  Or could it have just been a night-bird?  A crying bat?  Night is when the predators are out, you think, and wrack your brain trying to remember all of the nocturnal creatures you know.  Certainly bears are only out during the day.  There’s nothing out here that can sneak up and attack you, right?"
q0080,(not afraid),,q0081,c0076.0,,"Of course!  There’s no food left out that can attract any animals, and you smell like human, so it’s keeping most of them away.  Even if they do go sniffing, they most likely won’t want to waste the effort on clawing through this synthetic tent fabric.  Besides, you struggle to think as you yawn, so sleepy… "
q0081,,q0080,q0100,,,"You can’t tell if your eyes are open or shut, but any concerns and thoughts about the wilderness drift away on the abstract and dreamy threads of sleep, tugging you closer and closer to blissful unconsciousness."
q0090,(definitely afraid),,q0091,c0076.1,,"What if there are bears?  Or rabid foxes?  What if there is some kind of forest-cat prowling around your tent right now?  Wait—what was that sound?  It was like a branch cracking, something snapping… was it only a branch, or was it bones?"
q0091,,q0090,q0092,,,"What if something gets you while you’re asleep and unprotected?  Maybe you should have gone back while you still had the chance, while the cookies were still warm…"
q0092,,q0091,q0093,,,"You dwell on that thought, on fresh-from-the-oven cookies, your limbs too heavy to stimulate into real action.  Every now and then a sharp sound from the woods startles you, sending your heart briefly into a panic, but the lull of cookies is too strong for your weary mind."
q0093,,q0092,q0100,,,"You spend your last moments awake imagining the taste of your favorite cookies melting on your tongue, and your grandma’s soft hands brushing back your hair until you fall too far into dreams to care about the sounds of far-off animal cries and the less distant footfalls at the edge of the clearing.  Maybe your snoring will keep them all at bay anyway."
q0100,morning of a new day,q0093,q0101,,,"In the morning, you emerge from the tent, yawning and more than a bit sore.  Sleeping on the ground is rough.  It felt like you were laying on a root the entire night, and now you have knots in your back and kinks in your neck.  Maybe next time you can bring a less ratty sleeping bag."
q0101,,q0100,q0102,,,"You had put the fire out last night, but you miss it now because morning is cold.  You drag the sleeping bag out of the tent and wrap it around you.  Makeshift or not, it turns out to be an effective blanket and you eat your breakfast (hardboiled eggs and an apple), your mind on a thousand things.  You enjoy the peacefulness of the woods because it really allows you to think without interruption between crispy bites of the sweet, juicy apple."
q0102,,q0101,q0103,,,"You decide it’s time to head on, but are not sure if that means to continue exploring or call it a camping trip and return to your grandparents and the world of technology.  There are two ways you can continue exploring: you can travel back to the tree you marked at the fork and take the other path (where you can also decide to just leave the woods, if you change your mind), or you can set out on the path you didn’t explore last night, the one that goes deeper into the woods from here before it circles back on itself and returns to the clearing, which means you’d get back to the fork later in the day."
q0103,,q0102,q0104,,,"You pace around the tent and campfire as you ponder your choice, munching thoughtfully on the last of the apple."
q0104,,q0103,q0105,,,"When the apple is finished, you chuck it as far into the woods as you can—maybe someday it will grow into an apple tree.  You smile to yourself, because you’re at peace with the decision you’ve made about what comes next."
q0105,,q0104,q0106,,,"You pack up, which takes longer than setting up did.  You kick the remnants of the fire, shushing ash into the air.  Thankfully you won’t have to worry about lighting another fire, although you’re confident you can do it faster next time.  You drink the rest of the water bottle from last night, make sure you didn’t leave anything behind in the clearing, and then hike the bagged up tent onto your back."
q0106,Eighth decision,q0105,,,"c0106.0, c0106.1","Between heading back to your grandparents’ house and taking the path that continues on deeper into the woods, you know in your heart what you should do."
q0110,(back to the fork),,q0111,c0106.0,,"You make quick work of the path leading back to the fork.  The trail is familiar to you even though you’re going in the opposite direction as yesterday, which makes it easier for you to avoid the raised roots and tripfalls that slowed you down before."
q0111,,q0110,q0112,,,"Time hardly seems to pass before you’re standing in front of that large tree again.  Its branches arc over the two paths, branches hanging low from its numerous leaves and some kind of fruit dangling down.  They’re shaped like peaches and have the coloring of the apple you ate not too long ago, although this fruit wears it softer than the apple did."
q0112,,q0111,q0113,,,"The fruit looks good, but you wouldn’t trust anything you don’t recognize out in the wilderness.  What if it’s poisoned?  Grandma made you swear anyway that you wouldn’t eat anything that grew in the woods.  You don’t intend to break that promise, even though you know she only said it so it wouldn’t spoil your appetite for her cookies."
q0113,,q0112,q0114,,,"The mark you left in the tree is still there, the tree still jutting rudely in the path’s way, forcing the branching pathways to go around it.  .  You walk in front of it until you’re oriented the way you were the day before, with the choice of left or right and the path back home behind you."
q0114,Ninth decision,q0113,,,"c0114.0, c0114.1, c0114.2","Home.  Your grandparents’ house, their smiling faces and warm hugs, and those cookies; all of that’s right behind you.  To your right is unexplored territory, a little-traveled path in the woods where untold adventures might occur.  Left is the safe clearing and a roundabout path that will eventually lead you back here, as long as you stay on the path.  Your choices have never felt so laid out in front of you as they do right now."
q0120,(leave the woods),,q0121,c0114.2,,"You need to get back.  There are cookies waiting for you, for crying out loud!  Plus you’ll get to tell your grandparents all about your adventure.  They’ve probably missed you a lot.  Maybe grandma will make your favorite dinner too…"
q0121,,q0120,q0122,,,"The path is long but relatively straight just as you remember it from yesterday.  You know it’s not long, but you stop a little ways in to break out the other hardboiled eggs, because you’re feeling peckish again and eating always tastes better when you’re walking."
q0122,,q0121,q0123,,,"Almost before you’re ready the outcropping of rocks rises up before you, and you edge your way around.  The open yard looks strange and out of place after how enclosed the forest had been, but halfway across to the house you realize you’re used to it again."
q0123,,q0122,END,,,“Grandma!” you shout.  “I’m back!  Where are those cookies?”
q0130,(keep exploring beyond clearing),,q0131,c0033.1,,"You follow the path beyond the clearing, bringing your things with you.  The dirt path narrows, but never disappears into the underbrush, making it fairly easy to follow.  Small berry bushes line the trail intermittently between saplings and taller trees.  At one point the path crosses a small stream; thin and barely trickling, it nonetheless has a pleasant sound and soothing quality.  You watch the stream and see where it leads.  The ground slopes away to your right, the stream tumbling down with it.  You jump across the stream with little effort and keep walking."
q0131,,q0130,q0132,,,"The path, narrowing a bit more, meanders around but arcs overall to your right.  It gets harder and harder to remember the direction you’ve come from the further you follow.  How deep into the woods does this path go?  About half an hour later, you have to cross another stream.  Or maybe it’s the same one?  This one looks wider, more water gushing through than the first time.  You still have no problem getting across."
q0132,,q0131,q0133.0,,,"You follow the stream with your eyes.  Shadows are growing darker, making it harder to see what’s beyond the trail.  The ground seems to slope down sharply, with only a few tall trees poking the air at eye level, barely visible between the other trees.  A kind of dull roar emanates from the bottom of the slope where the stream ends up.  It must be some kind of waterfall!"
q0133.0,,q0132,q0133.1,,,"The trail, which had also been sloping steadily downhill, starts to rise again after walking for another fifteen or so minutes.  You trundle along, still enjoying the scenic route but feeling increasingly tired and thirsty from the extended walk.  Surely you’ve been hiking for at least two hours now, since entering into the woods.  The light wanes, which means it must be about sunset."
q0133.1,Nine and a halfth decision ,q0133.0,,,"c0133.1.0, c0133.1.1","You’re feeling quite hungry.  Had you set up your camp, you think, and not gone on exploring like you decided, you would probably be eating right now.  Should you just go ahead and eat, or should you save your sandwich for after you’ve gotten back to the clearing?"
q0133.2,,,q0134,c0133.1.1,,"It would probably be best to wait for dinner.  It’s still light out, which means you’ll have to go the rest of the night without anything else to eat, unless you’re willing to eat tomorrow’s sandwich as well as tonight’s.  That would be okay if you’re going straight back to your grandparents’ house in the morning, but what if you still want to explore throughout the day tomorrow?  If you eat now and then eat again later, you’ll be starving tomorrow!  Can’t have that.  Might as well just move on."
q0134,,"q0133.2, q0192",q0135,,,"Your legs tingle and itch where the blood pumps through your veins, and you bend over to scratch them as often you take small, needy sips from your water bottle.  The picnic basket is getting heavier in your hands and your stomach is starting to argue with you about when dinnertime is supposed to be.  You can hardly wait to shrug the tent off your back when suddenly the path ends."
q0135,,q0134,q0136,,,"The thin dirt path you’ve been following had been no more than a general depression in the underbrush, a symbolic kind of trail.  But now it’s obvious that even that much of a trail has come to an end.  You fret for a bit, wonderful if grandpa had lied and this path doesn’t circle around—that you’ll have to spend another hour and a half turning around to get back to that clearing, since you haven’t seen any forks in the path since embarking on the journey this side of the woods."
q0136,,q0135,q0137,,,"You decide to scout for a bit before you give up and just turn back around.  Dropping your pack and basket on what’s left of the path, you take a swig of your water and creep forward into the woods to search for another path nearby, any indication that there’s a way forward and not just one back."
q0137,,q0136,q0138.0,,,"You walk just a few feet into the trees and see, quite blatantly, a wide dirt trail not five feet ahead.  “Oh,” you say.  You creep onto the path and look up and down it.  “Oh,” you say again.  Sure enough, just to the left and past a small grove of trees is a clearing.  When you squint, you can just make out a ring of stones in the dusky light, stones that might perhaps be used to encircle a fire."
q0138.0,,q0137,q0138.1,,,"It’s the clearing!  The designated camping clearing this trail leads from!  You’ve found it.  You go back and grab your things, looking hard in the direction of the clearing and the wide path that leads from it.  Oddly, it’s utterly invisible from right where you’re standing.  Maybe it has something to do with the height of the ground, or a trick of the light.  But it’s strange that it can be so close yet impossible to notice."
q0138.1,,q0138.0,q0139,,,"Tent back over your shoulders and picnic basket hefted with renewed energy, you trot over to the wide path and rush into the clearing."
q0139,,q0138.1,q0140,,,"Your stomach lurches out from under you as you start to pitch forward, the bundled tent on your back dragging you down.  You drop the basket in order to fling your arms out to catch your fall, but you’re not fast enough.  You land face first in the dirt and groan miserably."
q0140,Tenth decision,q0139,,,"c0140.0, c0140.1","Your ankle throbs painfully while you manage to thrust the tent off your back.  You must have tripped over something sticking out of the dirt, a rock or root or something, but you can’t see anything in particular in the dim light eking from the clearing."
q0141,(are you okay?),,q0142,c0140.0,,"It hurts, and some tears come to your eyes.  The skin is hot and tender to the touch, and when you compare your ankles you’re positive one is bigger than the other."
q0142,Eleventh decision,q0141,,,"c0142.0, c0142.1","You have to make a quick judgment call—can you do this tonight or not?  Surely if you’re hurt, your grandparents will want to know.  You can call them and they can come get you.  You won’t have to worry about setting up your tent or suffering in the dark.  Also, there are ice packs in their freezer.  Ice would feel good right about now.  Otherwise you’re going to have to walk it off (figuratively speaking; you really shouldn’t be walking anywhere right now), and set up your camp if you want a place to sleep for the night.  Can you do that?  With a potentially sprained ankle?"
q0150,(call home),,q0151,c0142.0,,"It’s better for you to call.  If your ankle is sprained, staying out all night without ice might make it stiff, and trying to walk back on it in the morning might exacerbate the ankle and make it worse.  It’s really much better for you to just call this adventure over and go home before it’s truly night."
q0151,,q0150,q0152,,,"After a few calming breaths, you still feel really good about this decision, so you take your phone out of your pocket and call.  You grandma picks up right away with her familiar, shaky yet cheery “Hello?”"
q0152,,q0151,q0153,,,"You explain the situation, and she dispatches grandpa right away.  You start scrolling through your phone, anything to distract yourself from the pain, and grandpa is there at your side not twenty minutes later.  He’s a little out of breath and concerned for your injury, but overall happy to see you.  “These woods make me nervous at night.  Not a good place to be when you’re hurt,” he says, confirming you’ve made the right call.  “Come along.”"
q0153,,q0152,q0154,,,"He helps you up and hands you a crutch to help you walk, then pulls the still-bundled tent over his shoulder and hangs the picnic basket over the crook of his elbow.  You both have a flashlight, and while they’re on the night seems a lot darker, but you also feel more confident about following the path."
q0154,,q0153,END,,,"Together, you make it slowly but surely out of the woods.  Grandma is waiting for you by the back door, fretting nervously with her hands.  She gives you a grateful hug and ushers you inside, where she tells you she’s made your favorite for dinner.  “Are there still cookies left for dessert?”  She laughs.  “Of course there are.  Now come on in!”"
q0160,(make do for the night),,q0161,c0142.1,,"The ankle might be swelling, but the pain is already lessening to a tolerable amount.  You think you can make it through the night, and if you really need to you can choose to call in the morning.  Might as well wait and see how you’ll feel then rather than ruin your trip by an early judgment call."
q0161,,q0160,q0162,,,"With a few preparatory breaths and your hands steadily on the ground, you manage to make it to your feet with only the slightest wobble.  You test your foot with a couple of steps.  Even though it stings, the pain is not as bad as you had thought originally.  Given a few more minutes of rest, you should be right as rain—or at least able to hobble around to set up camp."
q0162,,q0161,q0163,,,"Those few minutes stabilize your heart rate and slow down your thinking.  You’ll have to set up your tent, for one thing.  The night is getting cold as surely as it’s getting darker, and the tempered material of the tent should help keep a lot of the wind away."
q0163,,q0162,q0175,,,"You’ll need some kind of light source to see by.  There’s a flashlight in the picnic basket, but a fire would give off more light.  The heat would probably also help your ankle feel better."
q0170,(shake it off),,q0171,c0140.1,,"It’s gotten quite dark under cover of the trees.  When you look up, you can’t see the sun anymore.  Venus is shining through the clouds, however, in the violet sky.  You stand shakily to your feet, and your leg immediately buckles underneath you.  Your ankle definitely hurts, but after a few bracing breaths and some words of encouragement, you’re able to stand up mostly straight."
q0171,,q0170,q0172,,,"You bend down, balancing like a yogi to distribute your weight in a less painful manner, and with one hand on your good leg, you pick up the tent with the other, and drag it over to the cleared space behind the stone firepit."
q0172,,q0171,q0173,,,"You go back and pick up the basket, having an easier time of it, although your ankle still throbs in time with your heartbeat, which is still sounding quite loudly in your ears.  The felled tree trunk is at a good height for sitting, so you struggle over to it and sit down gratefully as you go over your itinerary for the night."
q0173,,q0172,q0174,,,"Obviously you’re going to have to camp here.  You were expecting it—it was the goal for this trip, after all—but trying to walk anywhere on your hurt ankle is now out of the question.  You’re not crying over it, but you can feel from the uncomfortable pressure from your shoe that it’s starting to swell, and it’s better to let it rest up than to push it—who knows what else you might trip on in the dark if you try to make it back tonight?"
q0174,,q0173,q0175,,,"Before you can sleep, you need to set up your tent.  You’ll need some light for that, so getting some light would be a smart first step.  There’s a flashlight in the basket, but a fire would give off more light.  The heat might also help your ankle feel better, or at least allow you to ignore some of the pain.  A slight chill has taken hold of the night, and you can feel it cutting through the thin fabric of your coat with every gust that drops down through the clearing.  A fire would be perfect."
q0175,,q0174,q0176,,,"You also need to eat.  You watched your grandma pack the basket, and know that there’s just a couple sandwiches in there, plus some hard-boiled eggs and an apple.  Nothing needs to be cooked, so if you can’t manage to gather firewood right now it won’t be the end of the world."
q0176,Twelfth decision,q0175,,,"c0176.0, c0176.1","The clearing becomes incrementally darker with every passing minute.  You need to set up your tent, but with what light?"
q0180,,,q0181,c0023.1,,"There’s a log, and it’s blocking your path.  You can climb over it, but from the parts of the path that you can see, it looks too thorny and closed in for you to easily navigate through.  It might be worth it, but not while you’re carrying your bulky tent on your back.  It makes more sense to go set up camp and come back later."
q0181,13th decision,q0180,,,"c0023.0, c0114.2","You make it back to the fork.  Left brings you to the clearing, while going back the way you came takes you out of the woods."
q0190,,,q0191,c0133.1.0,,"You find a good rock to settle on, then move the tent off your back and onto the ground.  It doesn’t take you long to pull out one of the neatly wrapped sandwiches from the picnic basket and start shoveling it into your mouth."
q0191,,q0190,q0192,,,"You slow down your bites the less the sandwich remains.  Once you’re finished, you put the wrappings back into the basket and spy a thermos.  It’s sealed tightly, but when it’s open you’re rewarded with the fragrance of warm tea."
q0192,,q0191,q0134,,,The tea quenches your thirst and reinvigorates your muscles and your attitude.  You’re ready to move on.
q0200,,,q0201,c0176.0,,"Of course you should light a fire.  Granted, you’ve never made one on your own, but grandpa taught you and you’ve watched videos.  How hard can it be?"
q0201,,q0200,q0202,,,"Well, if gathering the wood is any signifier, pretty hard.  Your ankle throbs the entire time you scour the clearing and around a few trees for some fallen branches.  If you hadn’t been hurt, you probably would have been able to gather three times this much in the same amount of time, in the dark or not.  As it is, you’ll have to deal with the small armful you found.  At least you don’t need to cook your dinner."
q0202,,q0201,q0203,,,"Once the twigs are arranged in a semblance of what your grandpa said it’s supposed to look like, you pull out the flint tucked into the picnic basket and strike as hard as you can, again and again.  And some more.  Finally, after the sun’s been down and the cold has really started to set in, you get a spark to catch on some of the kindling grandpa provided with the flint.  It’s not bright or tall, but it is warm, and you let yourself sit beside it, feeding and prodding it, until you feel comfortable in your clothes once again."
q0203,,q0202,q0204,,,"While you’re still sitting on the ground, you take this moment to check on your ankle.  It’s definitely swollen, but the pain has gone down the longer you’ve sat beside the fire.  You give yourself a few more solid minutes of sitting and planning, and to feel entirely warm in this chilly night."
q0204,,q0203,q0205,,,"Once you’re up, you’re moving as quickly as possible to pitch this tent.  You thought about it enough as you coaxed the fire that you’re sure none of your movements will be wasted.  Sure enough, it’s only a matter of minutes before you’re limping to each of the stakes to hammer them firmly into the ground, pulling the tent taut."
q0205,,q0204,q0206,,,"Tent set up, fire cheery and warm, you stop and sit to rest and enjoy the night.  The stars are bright, what little you can see of them over the ambient light from the fire.  The breeze is cool and soothing, and dries some of the sweat on your skin.  You smile at the feeling, and then with a start remember that there’s dessert in your picnic basket!"
q0206,14th decision,q0205,,,"c0206.0, c0206.1","Under the other foods and some spare kindling, there is a little baggie filled with the ingredients for S’mores: slightly squashed marshmallows, flat squares of chocolate, and not-yet-broken graham crackers.  Taped to the bag is a little note."
q0210,,,q0212,c0206.0,,"It’s from your grandmother: “Something sweet for the sweetest person I know. Love, Grammy”.  Under her words is a little heart."
q0211,,,q0212,c0206.1,,"What does it matter what the note says?  It’s probably just something cutesy from your grandma.  Come to think of it, it might even be something a little admonishing.  Something along the lines of “Stay safe and don’t hurt yourself while you’re out there.”  Well, too late for that.  Reading those words would just make you feel guilty."
q0212,15th decision,"q0210, q0211",,,"c0212.0, c0212.1",You put the note aside and focus on the bag of S’mores stuff.  Should you eat them tonight?
q0220,,,q0221,c0212.0,,"Finally!  Something good is about to become of your night.  You take the ingredients out with something like reverence, doing you best to make sure the marshmallows don’t fall and the crackers don’t break before they end up in your mouth."
q0221,,q0220,q0222,,,"A toasting stick is in the basket, which means you don’t have to go walking around in the dark looking for an appropriate stick to shove into your marshmallow.  You lose some focus with the first marshmallow, between your ankle and your sleepy brain, and it ends up on fire.  Burnt marshmallows are still marshmallows, and the chocolate smothers a lot of the burnt flavors.  With a lot more attention, your second marshmallow is toasted to perfection, and you manage to eat the entirety of your second S’more, despite your stomach already arguing with you that it’s had enough."
q0222,,q0221,q0230,,,"Tongue and stomach equally satisfied from that delicious S’mores experience, you feel content and ready for bed."
q0223,,,q0230,c0212.1,,"The thought of S’mores right now is not appealing in the least.  In fact, it’s making you feel a little sick.  Although that might just be your ankle talking, but sick is sick, and those who are sick should not put so much sugar into their bodies."
q0230,,"q0222, q0223",q0231,,,"You pack everything up and tuck it into the back of the tent, being careful not to trip again and exacerbate your ankle more.  You take care of some camping odds and ends, tuck a few more loose bits into the tent beside your sleeping bag, and then pick up the bucket of sand next to the fire."
q0231,,q0230,q0232,,,"After a last moment of comfort from the fire, nearly dwindled now due to lack of wood but still warm, you dump enough sand over the fire to put it out.  You make sure it’s only smoke rising from the ashes and nothing smoldering before you set the bucket back in its place.  Before you turn in for the night, you look up at the sky, surrounded now with complete darkness."
q0232,,q0231,q0233,,,"The night sky is ablaze with bright pinpoints of light.  You’re not that far from civilization and lights, but you swear that through that small clearing in the woods you see more stars at once than you have entire nights back home with the sky stretched horizon to horizon.  It’s a sight to behold, and you lost track of time as you stare and drink it all in."
q0233,,q0232,q0234,,,"What a marvel nature is.  How insignificant we all are compared to the majesty of the universe!  You’re sure you could stand here all night and watch the sky shift on its invisible axis, and are contemplating just that when your ankle gives a fresh twinge of pain."
q0234,,q0233,q0235,,,"You crouch to hold your ankle, half to check how swollen it is, the other half to hold it together and press in the pain.  Hissing through the pain, you resolve to stand up and limp over to the tent.  Once inside, you collapse onto your sleeping bag.  It’s the work of a moment to wriggle inside, and before you can even think about what tomorrow will hold and what lives in the woods at night, you’re asleep."
q0235,new morning—ankle hurt,q0234,q0236,,,"When you wake up, you’re upset there’s no fire crackling out there for you.  It’s cold!  But Grandpa has told you time and again that you should never leave a fire lit when there’s no one around to tend it.  If the wind picks up a spark it can set your tent on fire while you’re sleeping, or cause other damage.  It always felt like a long shot kind of thing to you, but it never hurts to be cautious, especially when you’re all on your own."
q0236,,q0235,q0237,,,"You exit the tent, moaning, the sleeping bag wrapped around your shoulders.  It drags on the ground, but you don’t care.  You slept fitfully but at least your ankle feels a little better.  It’s not swollen anymore, but it still hurts whenever you bend it in even the slightest of unnatural directions."
q0237,,q0236,q0240,,,"On top of your ankle’s pain, you think you might have slept upon a tree root or some kind of small stone.  Your back and side are sore and your neck tight from tossing and turning.  If there’s a next time, you’ll have to sweep the ground properly under your tent, or bring a comfier bag to sleep in."
q0240,,q0237,q0241,,,"There’s an apple for breakfast and some hardboiled eggs.  You crack the eggs and peel them slowly, trying to work the kinks out of your muscles at the same time.  The egg tastes good, and the tea that’s left in your thermos resembles iced tea enough that you feel okay drinking it.  Your one complaint would be not having any salt for your eggs, but all things considered that’s not too bad."
q0241,,q0240,q0242,,,"As the sun rises higher into the sky, the chill of the morning wears off.  Slowly, you make your way around the camp, breaking down the tent and preparing yourself for the day and the long walk ahead of you.  There’s no question that you should head back as soon as you can.  Your ankle may feel better than last night, but it’s still hurt.  If you did manage to sprain it, you’d be doing yourself no favors recklessly traipsing around all day in the woods."
q0242,,q0241,q0243,,,"When your sleeping bag is tied to the bundled tent and resting again upon your back, you take the picnic basket in hand and set off down the path towards the fork at the large tree."
q0243,,q0242,q0244,,,"Your leg muscles are stiff as you start to walk.  It takes a good ten minutes for them to finally start to loosen up, but by then your ankle is protesting your weight.  You realize that you can’t go on any further or you might seriously hurt yourself.  Lowering the tent to the ground, you call your grandparents."
q0244,,q0243,q0245,,,"Grandma was upset to hear that you’ve hurt yourself, and Grandpa was upset you hadn’t called last night, but he’s promised to help you back to their house.  All you have to do now is wait.  You settle against a wide tree and, out of habit, find your phone in front of your face, ready for you to mindlessly look at it to kill time."
q0245,16th decision,q0244,,,"c0245.0, c0245.1","But you’re outside, surrounded by nature!  How rare is this, for you to safely detached from civilization?  You might as well take advantage of it while you can… although your phone is looking pretty appealing after a night without looking at it once."
q0250,,,q0251,c0245.0,,"You’ve had it with nature.  You’re ready to go back to the real world, back to people and man-made contraptions and the Internet.  Without much notice, your fingers have already pulled up your daily routine of checking emails and texts."
q0251,,q0250,q0252,,,"You missed some emails and a few texts during this little excursion.  Typing a few replies, you feel grateful that you caught your phone when you did.  Who knows how many other people might have tried to contact you before you’re back at your grandparents’ house and able to respond freely?  You might have just avoided a very overwhelming experience.  This makes you feel grateful, just a little, for the state of your ankle.  Without falling last night, you might have wanted to continue exploring today.  How long then would you have stayed away from your phone?  Too long, that’s for sure."
q0252,,q0251,END,,,"It feels like no time at all before Grandpa is at your side, handing you a walking stick and pulling the tent onto his own back.  You insist on taking the picnic basket, and the two of you walk back out of the woods together.  Along the way, you tell him about the stream and the stars and how you fell.  He tells you that there are still some cookies left from last night.  That knowledge lifts your spirits, and you walk back to the house with a careful bounce in your step, satisfied with your little adventure and ready to face the real world once again."
q0260,,,q0261,c0245.1,,"It’s only fifteen minutes.  You may feel a little bored, just waiting around as your muscles stiffen up again and your hands get cold, but the fresh air alone makes it worth it.  The subdued silence presses in on you, but never becomes stifling.  You can hear birds chirping in surround sound, and the slight rustling of the bushes and leaves from the wind brings a sense of peace you haven’t felt in a long time.  Besides last night when you stared at the stars, of course."
q0261,,q0260,q0262,,,"When Grandpa finds you, you try not to grimace as you stand to greet him.  Instead, you smile as he picks up your bundled tent and hands you a walking stick.  When he asks how your night was, you don’t dwell on the root under your sleeping bag or how you fell.  Rather, you try to explain how you felt when you heard the waterfall in the woods, how liberating silence can be and how relaxing fresh air is to breathe.  How small the world feels when compared to all of the stars in the sky.  You find yourself hard-pressed for the right words, however.  Plus, the woods feel right now like a library, as though chattering away in them would be disrespectful.  So besides the pleasantries and a promise to tell all once you’re back in the house, the two of you walk side by side in silence."
q0262,,q0261,q0263,,,"As you reach the rocky entrance to the woods, you feel something like regret at the thought of leaving.  “Can I come camping again sometime?” you ask.  Words feel more appropriate in the brightly lit expanse of their open lawn behind the house.  “Of course,” Grandpa says, shrugging the tent from one shoulder to the other.  “Anytime.”"
q0263,,q0262,END,,,"Free to come camping here, anytime.  “Good,” you muse, thinking already about your next adventure into the woods.  “Good.”"
