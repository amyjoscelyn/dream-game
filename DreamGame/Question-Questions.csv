BEGINNING,Beginning,—,q0001,,,You walk into the woods.
q0001,,q0000,q0002,,,"They are peaceful, serene.  The leaves filter the sun and lend a dusty green atmosphere to your surroundings.  The trees are tall and wide and bristling with branches, mostly deciduous, although there are some spruces and pines mixed in."
q0002,,q0001,q0003,,,"The path you are following is little more than a dirt road, hidden behind a rocky outcropping in the back of your grandparent’s yard.  You’ve decided today that you want to see where it goes."
q0003,,q0002,q0004,,,"The breath you took before you took the first step was shaky yet brave.  After five minutes on the path, however, stepping over raised roots and clods of dirt, you feel there’s nothing here you need to be scared of.  In fact, these woods are quite boring."
q0004,First decision,q0003,,,"c0004.0, c0004.1","Grandma was baking cookies.  They might even be coming out of the oven right now.  There’s still time to go back, before it gets too dark, while the path is still straightforward and true."
q0010,(Go back),,q0011,c0004.0,,"She said she was making your favorite.  By the time you get back to the house, they’ll probably be cool and good to eat!"
q0011,,q0010,END,,,What a fun afternoon adventure!  Maybe you can go back to the woods the next time you visit.
END,Ending,q0011,—,,,THE END.
q0020,(Keep going),,q0021,c0004.1,,"You know she was only making those cookies to entice you to stay, even though she agreed to let you camp in the woods for the night.  She’s worried about nothing, you think.  The woods are fine.  All you need is to find a nice clearing, set up your tent, maybe build a little fire, and then return in the morning."
q0021,,q0020,q0022,,,"You continue on until you reach a fork.  A large tree blocks the path from continuing forward, which make this a traditional fork: the path continues on to the left and to the right."
q0022,,q0021,q0023,,,"Grandpa told you about this fork.  He said there are only a few in this part of the woods.  To the left, the path reaches a nice clearing and then the path continues on, where it eventually circles back and leads right back to this fork.  You wouldn’t get lost at all, as long as you mark the tree.  That way, upon your return, you can notice your mark and then turn back onto the path that led you here in the first place."
q0023,Second decision,q0022,,,"c0023.0, c0023.1","You look to the left.  The path is clear and if you squint you can almost see a break in the trees down the way.  Surety and safety lead to the left.  You look to the right.  In comparison, the path is smaller, less worn, and meanders so much you lose it after it rounds a few trees.  The left might be perfect for a camping trip, but the right would be perfect for a true adventure."
q0030,(Go left),,q0031,c0023.0,,"You follow the pathway.  The way is easy going, and before long you come upon the clearing."
q0031,,q0030,q0032,,,"The clearing is not as large as you expected, about as large as your room at home and practically round.  The ground, flat and clear, leaves enough space for your tent between the edge of the trees and a small ring of stones that looks to be an old firepit with a bucket of sand propped nearby for when its time to put the fire out.  A low trunk from a felled tree rests nearby."
q0032,,q0031,q0033,,,"Setting the picnic basket grandma carefully packed for you, you ease the tent bag off your shoulders and lean it against your legs, allowing yourself a moment of rest."
q0033,Third decision,q0032,,,"c0033.0, c0033.1","This clearing is just as grandpa promised, and would make a great place to camp.  As you look around, you notice a smaller path leading away the opposite way you came.  Even though you squint, you can’t follow where it goes for long.  This must the path that continues on, like grandpa said, that eventually leads back into this clearing.  Two choices make themselves apparent in your mind."
q0040,(Set up camp now),,q0041,c0033.0,,"You look up at the sky.  You can barely see where the sun is positioned through the trees—its pretty close to the horizon.  This part of the country gets dark pretty early.  It’s better to have your camp set up now, so that you don’t need to worry about doing it without the light."
q0041,,q0040,q0042,,,"First you pitch your tent, hammering the stakes deep into the loamy earth.  The smell of the soil wafts into your face.  You’ve helped pitch tents before, so this doesn’t take too long.  The fire will be another story.  You’ve never started one all by yourself."
q0042,,q0041,q0043,,,"You gather some firewood, dry wood littered on the forest floor.  You arrange the twigs and snapped branches carefully, just as grandpa told you how."
q0043,,q0042,q0044,,,"Taking the flint out of the picnic basket, you recall how grandpa taught you and start a fire (it takes a dozen tries, with a short break for your hands and a quick self-validation session, but you manage to light it before too much time has passed).  The fire is small, and you spend more time than you expected tending it with a thick branch."
q0044,,q0043,q0045,,,"By the time you’re satisfied with your little fire, the clearing is almost dark.  The last vestiges of the sunset is hidden by the leafy canopy overhead.  Just a small circle of sky is visible between the trees, and you can make out Venus shining through the clouds in the purpling sky."
q0045,"Third and a half decision, hungry for dinner",q0044,,,c0045.0,"Your stomach grumbles happily as you crouch beside the fire, warming your hands.  Good thing your dinner is packed!"
q0046,(dinnertime),,q0047,c0045.0,,"You open the picnic basket grandma packed for you and eat one of the sandwiches she wrapped so nicely in a waxy napkin.  There is an apple, but you figure you’ll save that and the other sandwich plus the hard boiled eggs for tomorrow.  She packed you a juice box, and you smile as you poke the straw into it and squeeze the sweet, tangy liquid into your mouth."
q0047,"Fourth decision, s’mores ingredients discovered",q0046,,,"c0047.0, c0047.1","Underneath the other foods, you spy a little baggie tucked into the corner.  Inside it contains a few marshmallows, some not-yet-broken graham crackers, and a small pile of chocolate wafers.  A little note is taped to the bag."
q0048.0,(read note),,q0049,c0047.0,,"It’s just a little message from your grandma: “Something sweet for the sweetest person I know. Love, Grammy”.  She added a little heart at the bottom."
q0048.1,(ignore note),,q0049,c0047.1,,"It’s probably just some stupid lovey note from your grandma.  Probably trying to tell you to give up camping and come back to the house, just like she tried to do with the cookies.  Why is she trying so hard to keep you from camping?  You don’t need that.  You crumple up the note and toss it over your shoulder."
q0049,Fifth decision,"q0048.0, q0049.1",,,"c0049.0, c0049.1","You turn your attention back to the bag of S’mores ingredients.  Raging fire (well, it’s more than smoldering, at least), some chocolate and those big puffy marshmallows…"
q0050.0,(camping treat),,q0051.0,c0049.0,,What’s better than this on your first camping trip alone?  Who cares if you’re only fifteen minutes away from your grandparent’s house?   This is what living is all about!
q0051.0,done with dinner,q0050.0,q0052,,,"The S’mores are sweet, as promised, and you eat your fill.  With a bit of a tummyache, you stand up and stretch, cleaning up your impromptu dinner and dessert back into the picnic basket."
q0050.1,(camping restraint),,q0051.1,c0049.1,,"After that sandwich, you’re more full than you thought.  Sweet note or no, you’re not feeling the S’mores tonight."
q0051.1,done with dinner,q0050.1,q0052,,,"You stand up and stretch, and with a sigh begin to clean up your impromptu dinner back into the picnic basket."
q0052,post-dinner,"q0051.0, q0051.1",q0053,,,"You tend to the fire as the night settles deeper into the sky.  Flickering shadows stretch out from the fire, and although you can feel the woods pressing in onto the clearing, you feel calm and surprisingly at peace here in the circle of light."
q0053,Sixth decision,q0052,,,"c0053.0, c0053.1","Your body aches slightly from the bout of walking earlier, but it’s not so bad that you want to go to bed right away.  You can sit out and enjoy the night a little longer.  Of course, if you go to sleep now, you might be more inclined to wake up early and explore while the day is still young."
q0060,(stay up),,q0061,c0053.1,,"The fire crackles warmly at your feet, warming your knees and shins.  Beyond the fire, you hear the sounds of the forest: trees creaking, owls hooting, the rustling of bushes where small animals are settling into their homes for the night.  The fire feels nice and warm, and lulls you peacefully."
q0061,,q0060,q0062,,,"The stars are dim, but sure to get brighter the longer you stay up.  You watch the shadows press ever closer towards you, like the clearing is being swaddled by a cozy blanket.  The forest breathes around you, and you find yourself breathing to the same tempo, your heart beating with the pulse of the living earth around you.  Allowing the fire lose some of its body and light, you take the world in with your deep, calm breaths, and then look up again at the sky."
q0062,,q0061,q0063,,,"Now the stars stand out like crystal, brilliant jewels set into the velvet cloth of the sky.  The night seems all at once vast and encompassing yet safe and snug.  You feel yourself falling into the distance of the sky, mesmerized by those tiny pinpricks of light and the whole world of galaxies they represent."
q0063,,q0062,q0064,,,"By the time an unconsciously large yawn shakes you out of your reverie, the fire is just a few remaining glowing embers against the lush darkness of the woods.  You yawn again as you stand, feeling your limbs numbs with cold.  You stretch until your body tingles as you get the blood pumping just enough to finish up the last tasks before you can go to bed."
q0064,,q0063,q0073,,,"From the picnic basket, you pull out a bottle of water to keep beside you while you sleep and the flashlight that’s tucked inside.  Setting those inside the tent next to the sleeping bag, you focus on making sure you left nothing out that would attract any animals while you sleep.  Seeing nothing you forgot, you pick up the picnic basket and set it into the back of the tent, so you won’t trip over it in the night."
q0070,(go to bed),,q0071,c0053.0,,"You take your time as you wander around the clearing, preparing your body for sleep after your long walk in the woods.  You hear some animal sounds coming at you from a distance: there are hooting owls out there, and the shifting of underbrush from the smaller creatures.  You’re sure there are larger ones out there too, but you try not to think of them because you don’t want to have nightmares tonight.  You remind yourself that your grandparents are not that far away, snug in their house.  You’re sure if it comes down to it that you’ll be able to find your way out of the woods without any problem."
q0071,,q0070,q0072,,,"The picnic basket is by your feet.  In the flickering light of the fire, you reach into the basket and pull out one of the water bottles tucked inside and the flashlight.  You look up towards the sky as you take a quick swig of the water and watch the dark leaves sway against the blue-black night.  You can just make out some stars with your fire-blind eyes, although they twinkle out of existence whenever you try to look right at them."
q0072,,q0071,q0073,,,"You take another sip of the water, and then twist the cap on firmly and tuck both the bottle and the flashlight into the tent beside the entrance.  The picnic basket goes further inside the tent so you don’t have to worry about tripping over it in a state of half-sleep."
q0073,last-minute bedtime preparations,"q0064, q0072",q0074,,,"After a few more minutes of other bed-preparation activities, you’re finally ready to tuck in for the night.  You throw the sand over the remains of your low-burning fire until it flickers out of existence."
q0074,,q0073,q0075,,,"You set the bucket back beside the stones in the sudden darkness.  More out of sensation than sight you stumble over to the tent, stifling a jaw-cracking yawn.  You let yourself into the tent and tug on the zipper until the entrance closes tight."
q0075,inside sleeping bag at last,q0074,q0076,,,"Without further ado, you wriggle sleepily into your sleeping bag, fluff your pillow, and close your eyes to fall asleep."
q0076,Seventh decision,q0075,,,"c0076.0, c0076.1","It’s very quiet, now that you’re inside the tent and the fire is out.  The darkness presses against your eyes, even when they’re open.  You snuggle deeper into your sleeping bag.  Was that a wolf howling?  Or could it have just been a night-bird?  A crying bat?  Night is when the predators are out, you think, and wrack your brain trying to remember all of the nocturnal creatures you know.  Certainly bears are only out during the day.  There’s nothing out here that can sneak up and attack you, right?"
q0080,(not afraid),,q0081,c0076.0,,"Of course!  There’s no food left out that can attract any animals, and you smell like human, so it’s keeping most of them away.  Even if they do go sniffing, they most likely won’t want to waste the effort on clawing through this synthetic tent fabric.  Besides, you struggle to think as you yawn, so sleepy… "
q0081,,q0080,q0100,,,"You can’t tell if your eyes are open or shut, but any concerns and thoughts about the wilderness drift away on the abstract and dreamy threads of sleep, tugging you closer and closer to blissful unconsciousness."
q0090,(definitely afraid),,q0091,c0076.1,,"What if there are bears?  Or rabid foxes?  What if there is some kind of forest-cat prowling around your tent right now?  Wait—what was that sound?  It was like a branch cracking, something snapping… was it only a branch, or was it bones?"
q0091,,q0090,q0092,,,"What if something gets you while you’re asleep and unprotected?  Maybe you should have gone back while you still had the chance, while the cookies were still warm…"
q0092,,q0091,q0093,,,"You dwell on that thought, on fresh-from-the-oven cookies, your limbs too heavy to stimulate into real action.  Every now and then a sharp sound from the woods startles you, sending your heart briefly into a panic, but the lull of cookies is too strong for your weary mind."
q0093,,q0092,q0100,,,"You spend your last moments awake imagining the taste of your favorite cookies melting on your tongue, and your grandma’s soft hands brushing back your hair until you fall too far into dreams to care about the sounds of far-off animal cries and the less distant footfalls at the edge of the clearing.  Maybe your snoring will keep them all at bay anyway."
q0100,morning of a new day,q0093,q0101,,,"In the morning, you emerge from the tent, yawning and more than a bit sore.  Sleeping on the ground is rough.  It felt like you were laying on a root the entire night, and now you have knots in your back and kinks in your neck.  Maybe next time you can bring a less ratty sleeping bag."
q0101,,q0100,q0102,,,"You had put the fire out last night, but you miss it now because morning is cold.  You drag the sleeping bag out of the tent and wrap it around you.  Makeshift or not, it turns out to be an effective blanket and you eat your breakfast (hardboiled eggs and an apple), your mind on a thousand things.  You enjoy the peacefulness of the woods because it really allows you to think without interruption between crispy bites of the sweet, juicy apple."
q0102,,q0101,q0103,,,"You decide it’s time to head on, but are not sure if that means to continue exploring or call it a camping trip and return to your grandparents and the world of technology.  There are two ways you can continue exploring: you can travel back to the tree you marked at the fork and take the other path (where you can also decide to just leave the woods, if you change your mind), or you can set out on the path you didn’t explore last night, the one that goes deeper into the woods from here before it circles back on itself and returns to the clearing, which means you’d get back to the fork later in the day."
q0103,,q0102,q0104,,,"You pace around the tent and campfire as you ponder your choice, munching thoughtfully on the last of the apple."
q0104,,q0103,q0105,,,"When the apple is finished, you chuck it as far into the woods as you can—maybe someday it will grow into an apple tree.  You smile to yourself, because you’re at peace with the decision you’ve made about what comes next."
q0105,,q0104,q0106,,,"You pack up, which takes longer than setting up did.  You kick the remnants of the fire, shushing ash into the air.  Thankfully you won’t have to worry about lighting another fire, although you’re confident you can do it faster next time.  You drink the rest of the water bottle from last night, make sure you didn’t leave anything behind in the clearing, and then hike the bagged up tent onto your back."
q0106,Eighth decision,q0105,,,"c0106.0, c0106.1","Between heading back to your grandparents’ house and taking the path that continues on deeper into the woods, you know in your heart what you should do."
q0110,(back to the fork),,q0111,c0106.0,,"You make quick work of the path leading back to the fork.  The trail is familiar to you even though you’re going in the opposite direction as yesterday, which makes it easier for you to avoid the raised roots and tripfalls that slowed you down before."
q0111,,q0110,q0112,,,"Time hardly seems to pass before you’re standing in front of that large tree again.  Its branches arc over the two paths, branches hanging low from its numerous leaves and some kind of fruit dangling down.  They’re shaped like peaches and have the coloring of the apple you ate not too long ago, although this fruit wears it softer than the apple did."
q0112,,q0111,q0113,,,"The fruit looks good, but you wouldn’t trust anything you don’t recognize out in the wilderness.  What if it’s poisoned?  Grandma made you swear anyway that you wouldn’t eat anything that grew in the woods.  You don’t intend to break that promise, even though you know she only said it so it wouldn’t spoil your appetite for her cookies."
q0113,,q0112,q0114,,,"The mark you left in the tree is still there, the tree still jutting rudely in the path’s way, forcing the branching pathways to go around it.  .  You walk in front of it until you’re oriented the way you were the day before, with the choice of left or right and the path back home behind you."
q0114,Ninth decision,q0113,,,"c0114.0, c0114.1, c0114.2","Home.  Your grandparents’ house, their smiling faces and warm hugs, and those cookies; all of that’s right behind you.  To your right is unexplored territory, a little-traveled path in the woods where untold adventures might occur.  Left is the safe clearing and a roundabout path that will eventually lead you back here, as long as you stay on the path.  Your choices have never felt so laid out in front of you as they do right now."
q0120,(leave the woods),,q0121,c0114.2,,"You need to get back.  There are cookies waiting for you, for crying out loud!  Plus you’ll get to tell your grandparents all about your night out.  They’ve probably missed you a lot.  Maybe grandma will make your favorite dinner too…"
q0121,,q0120,q0122,,,"The path is long but relatively straight just as you remember it from yesterday.  You know it’s not long, but you stop a little ways in to break out the other hardboiled eggs, because you’re feeling peckish again and eating always tastes better when you’re walking."
q0122,,q0121,q0123,,,"Almost before you’re ready the outcropping of rocks rises up before you, and you edge your way around.  The open yard looks strange and out of place after how enclosed the forest had been, but halfway across to the house you realize you’re used to it again."
q0123,,q0122,END,,,“Grandma!” you shout.  “I’m back!  Where are those cookies?”
