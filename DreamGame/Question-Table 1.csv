BEGINNING,intro,,,—,q001,,,"As a fourteen year old girl from a magical family in the secret land of Belvig, you’re expected to attend Aeithlynik, the private National School for Young Witches.  Considering how your mother and grandmother and her mother and grandmother all attended Aeithlynik, you know you’re guaranteed an invitation to attend, but that does not mean you can skip the application."
q001,,,,BEGINNING,q002,,,"The application is a long-held tradition for Aeithlynik.  The Headmistress, Agatha McMillan, reads each and every application to determine whether they’re a good fit for her school.  If a girl passes, the professors all read over her letter to decide the major of study for which she’d be best suited.  If a girl fails, she is declined an invitation and encouraged to attend the public, co-education magical school at the bottom of the hill."
