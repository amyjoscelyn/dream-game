A few others nearby are swaying as well, and you waltz over to join them.  Music plays smoothly from a balcony above, a counterpoint to the susurration of conversation from those around you.  Their words blend together, creating melodies and harmonies that, when you let your mind float inside it, you swear you can hear the rhythm to.  It’s a catching rhythm, and all you want to do is dance, dance… twirl and leap to the music of the room until you float into the air.  Tonight, it all seems possible. +++romantic" indexNumber:0002];

Sounds and smells all mesh into one, and as you sip on your sweet beverage you feel the sights mingling into the mix as well, until you swear you can smell the music of the orchestra, a lovely floral bouquet of strings and horns; the aromas coming from the banquet tables rising like colored smoke; the guests in their finery of red and gold like a waterfall in the eaves,  their dancing like the roar of a train down a crevasse, a waved golden ticket like the ringing of a bell… +++whimsical" indexNumber:0003];

You make your way through groups and couples over to the hardened stone of the dance floor, polished and surprisingly forgiving in the warm, golden light.  There you take a partner and the two of you whirl around, secrets and the hum of mischief fluttering around like the wings of a bat.  The most wondrous way to spend an evening, and the best night you’ve had in awhile… +++subtle/graceful" indexNumber:0004];

/*
 some things to do:
    make AMYChoice take in 6 choice options, but if you leave a few blank, they are not counted
    make custom cell above current one to hold all story text, or find a way to make the section headers larger
    figure out a way to store the story snippets somewhere other than here
    when choice is chosen, provide the correct next snippet
