    //Once I know whether it's Effect or Prerequisite, I need to determine whether it's on Playthrough or Character.  Each of those go to their own method managers.
    //It gets tricky at this point, because there are a lot more actionProperties than actionObjects to keep track of.  But it goes similarly--find the match, and do the thing to it.  (Or check against it).
    //Maybe I'll be able to parse down better with the comparator/operator--make that a sort of Group name, with the properties Grouped together based on type.  So it'll be a Type.  If it's a boolType (making/checking YES or NO), or a stringType (saving or checking to a string), or an integerType (adding or subtracting numbers, or checking equality), then that would narrow the properties down a lot, making the subsequent method called a lot more refined.
