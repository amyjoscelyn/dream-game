q00,intro,,c00,,Your Day Off
q01,first decision point,,"c01,c02,c03",,"It’s your day off!  You have the whole day ahead of you, to do whatever you please.  What would you like to do?"
q02,branch - park,,,q03,"Go to the park, of course!  It’s close by, and you have the opportunity to enjoy several activities while you’re there.  Feeling inspired, you pull out your old picnic basket from out of the back of the closet, and fill it with food."
q03,branch - park,,,q04,"It's a bright and beautiful morning! Birds are singing merrily, children laugh as they play, and when you breathe deeply the air is crisp and clear.  You couldn’t have asked for a better day!"
q04,branch - park,,,q05,"Of everything available at the park, you decide to spend some time swinging.  Your feet launch you off the ground and your legs feel strong and powerful as you allow yourself high and higher in the air.  You indulge in the nostalgic whoosh of your stomach, and when you’ve had enough you look carefully around—making sure no one’s watching—and leap off, just like old times!"
q05,branch - park,,,q06,"After a long walk to acclimate yourself back to the ground, a cool and refreshing breeze accompanying you the entire way, you find a pretty clearing in the woods—the perfect spot for your picnic lunch!"
q06,branch - park,,,q07,"Is there anything better than a picnic in a grassy meadow on a beautiful day?  You packed sandwiches and fruit and some bottles of juice, plus some goodies for dessert.  You much happily on your food, reveling in this glorious moment.  As you pack up your food, you look up and—wait, is that… could that be… it is!  You flag your good friend down, and you jovially catch up on the time since you last hung out."
q07,branch - park,,,q08,"The two of you talk for ages, and when dinnertime arrives (your stomach grumbling despite the amount of food you consumed not that long ago), your friend suggests barbecue for dinner!  The park has grills to use for free, and planning on that, your friend has more than enough food to share with you."
q08,branch - park,,,q09,"Food tastes better grilled, you think, and you eat every last bite.  You even lick your fingers unashamedly; it tasted so good!  By the time you’ve finished, the sun has already begun to set, and you realize it’s time to head back home."
q09,branch - park,,,q23,"You had an enjoyable day at the park!  You took in a lot of nature, frolicked when you could, and even had a nice barbecue.  Back home, you feel exhausted and completely satisfied."
q10,branch - shop,,,q11,"Shopping!  What a wonderful excuse to get out of the house for the day.  You don’t make it into town enough, and always love being there when you can go.  There are plenty of little shops and boutiques, and since you’ve just been given a bonus (it’s about time…) you’ll actually be able to buy things without feeling guilty!"
q11,branch - shop,,,q12,"The morning is clear and bright as you make your way to one of the little plazas in town.  The streets are lined with quaint stores—you find one right away you want to go into, filled with tasteful clothes and shoes.  After trying a bunch of things on, you manage to find a nice new outfit for work, as well as something fun to wear when you go out.  Across the street, you spy a shop that just opened up, and decide today’s the day you check it out!"
q12,branch - shop,,,q13,"It's eccentric and unique, but it has a homey feel and you can tell right away that it’s going to become one of your favorite stores.  You pick up a few things to decorate your place and even manage to score a few items that would make perfect gifts for some friends.  You exit the shop and peek around, wondering what store you should go into next when your stomach grumbles loudly."
q13,branch - shop,,,q14,"You put your shopping bags into the trunk of your car, and then walk a few blocks down to a local deli.  Everyone’s friendly there, and as you’re finishing up your lunch the manager comes over and asks you to try a cookie, on the house—they just came out of the oven, and want some feedback before they put them on the menu.  The cookie is melt-in-your-mouth warm and delicious to boot.  When you tell her so, she beams widely and tells you to come back, anytime!"
q14,branch - shop,,,q15,"Browsing and window shopping fills most of your afternoon.  By the time you’ve walked down each side of the block, you find you’re feeling peckish.  A high-end bakery stands not too far from where you parked, so on your way to the car you duck into the bakery and buy a couple croissants for the morning, as well as a little cupcake for right now.  The snack brings some pep back into your step, so instead of going right home, you decide to go see a movie!"
q15,branch - shop,,,q16,"It’s refreshing to see a movie by yourself and not have to worry about anyone else—but you have to admit you miss the company.  You know where company’s waiting, however, so you call for a reservation at your favorite restaurant and meet your friend.  The two of you share a wonderful, laughter-filled meal until you’re ready to go home."
q16,branch - shop,,,q23,"After a full day of shopping, you bring home quite the haul, full of nice deals.  Pleased and proud, you show off your purchases and relive the memory of the movie (and that freshly baked cookie!).  After a day on your feet, however, you feel more than ready to fall into your bed and sleep."
q17,,,,q18,"Mmm, what can possibly be better than getting to laze around home all day, nowhere you need to go, no place you need to be!  You snuggle deeper into your bedcovers and sleep in, for the first time in a while!  When you finally rouse yourself to get up, you purposefully don’t bother to put on real clothes, and set yourself up for a comfortable and indulgent day at home."
q18,,,,q19,"Your day begins with popcorn for breakfast and TV!  You're a few episodes behind on your favorite show, so you decide to start there.  Once that’s finished, you move on to your second favorite show.  Once they're both caught up, you realize it’s well past lunch."
q19,,,,q20,"Thank goodness there are leftovers in the fridge—you don’t feel like putting a lot of effort into anything today.  While you eat, you decide to try a new show that’s piqued your interest.  You’ve heard good things, but want to see for yourself how it is.  A few hours later, you emerge from the fog and, hungry again, realize how dark it’s gotten outside."
q20,,,,q21,"Pushing yourself up takes a lot of effort, but once you’re in the kitchen you find you actually have the energy to make a decent meal, for once.  Dinner tastes excellent, and instead of watching more TV (the couch still holds your impression from the long day of not moving), you manage to occupy yourself with that book you’ve been meaning to read."
q21,,,,q22,"Time flies, and you’re several chapters in when you start to yawn too audibly to ignore.  Dumping the dishes in the sink, you head for bed, but can’t pass the couch without sitting in it once more and turning the TV back on.  You’ll just watch one more episode…"
q22,,,,q23,"At last you remove yourself from the couch and stretch mightily.  What a productive lazy day!  You caught up on two shows, and started a new one, but also read a book, which means you didn’t spend the entire day lying down.  Satisfied, you’re more than ready for bed."
q23,,,c04,,"Your bed is freshly made, and you yawn widely as you turn down the covers.  What a wonderful day off!  You lay down and let your body sink into the comfortable bed.  You’re fast asleep almost before your head hits the pillow and you dream of a good night’s sleep."
