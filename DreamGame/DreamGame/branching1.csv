1,decision point 0,Spend the day at the park. | 2,Shop in town. | 5,Stay in and watch tv. | 8,,,,"It’s your day off!  You have the whole day ahead of you, to do whatever you please.  What would you like to do?"
2,branch - park,Go to the park. | 3,,,,,,"Go to the park, of course!  It’s close by, and you have the opportunity to enjoy several activities while you’re there.  How will you travel there?"
3,branch - park,Return home. | 4,,,,,,"It’s a bright and beautiful morning.  The birds are singing merrily and children are laughing as they play.  Of everything available to do at the park, you decide to spend some time swinging.  Then you take a long walk, enjoying the cool breeze through the peaceful woods.  Afterwards, you snack on your picnic lunch, dining with a friend you noticed happening by.  The two of you talk for ages, and when dinnertime arrives, you enjoy some barbecue from the park’s grills until the sun sets and it’s finally time to head back home."
4,branch - park,Go to bed.,,,,,,"You had an enjoyable day at the park!  You took in a lot of nature, frolicked when you could, and even had a nice barbecue.  Back home, you feel exhausted and completely satisfied."
5,branch - shopping,Go into town. | 6,,,,,,"Shopping!  What a wonderful excuse to get out of the house for the day.  There are plenty of little shops and boutiques, and since you’ve just been given a bonus, you’ll actually be able to buy some things!"
6,branch - shopping,Return home. | 7,,,,,,"The morning is clear and bright as you make your way to the best plaza in town.  The street is full of quaint stores, filled with clothes you like, decorations for your home, and little souvenirs.  You find a surprising amount of good deals, and even manage to get a few gifts ahead of time.  By the time lunch roles around, you’re starving enough to eat a full meal at the local deli.  Browsing and window shopping fills the rest of the afternoon, and you have the chance to pop into a high-end bakery for a quick pick-me-up snack.  It peps you up enough to shop a little more, this time for books and games and movies, and you stop in for dinner at your favorite restaurant before you realize it’s time to get back home."
7,branch - shopping,Go to bed.,,,,,,"After a full day of shopping, you bring home quite the haul, full of nice deals.  Pleased and proud, you show off your purchases, and after a day on your feet feel more than ready for bed."
8,branch - home,To the couch! | 9,,,,,,"Mmm, what can possibly be better than getting to laze around home all day, nowhere you need to go, no place you need to be!  You purposefully don’t bother to put on real clothes, and set yourself up for living large at home."
9,branch - home,Gotta love TV. | 10,,,,,,"Your day starts and ends with Netflix.  You’re a few episodes behind on your two favorite shows.  By the time you’ve finished them, it’s well past lunch.  All’s good, though—there are leftovers in the fridge.  Over lunch, you decide to start a new show that’s piqued your interest.  A few hours later, you emerge from the Netflix fog and realize how dark it’s gotten outside.  Pushing yourself up takes a lot of effort, but once you’re in the kitchen you find you actually have the energy to make a decent meal, for once.  Dinner tastes excellent, and instead of watching more tv (the couch still holds your impression from the long day), you manage to occupy yourself with a book you’ve been meaning to read.  Then, dumping the dishes in the sink, you go back to the couch and watch just one more episode of that new show…"
10,branch - home,Go to bed.,,,,,,"Once you finally get up off the couch, you stretch mightily.  What a productive lazy day!  You caught up on two shows, and started a new one, without spending the entire day lying down.  Satisfied, you’re ready for bed."
11,end,,"Night-night!",,,,,"Your bed is freshly made, and you yawn as you turn down the covers.  What a wonderful day off!  You lay down and let your body sink into your comfortable bed, and you’re fast asleep almost before you head hits the pillow, dreaming of a good night’s sleep."
