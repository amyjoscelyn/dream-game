/*
 Okay.  So we have raw csv data of choices that needs to be parsed through to get the choices into their proper property homes within this entity.  If I were to have a generateChoices method, it could do something similar to the Question generateQuestions method.  Then, when I need a choice, they're already all here.  I can just access this font of them, go through this source, and take only the ones I need, as in the ones that match the ID of the current question.  It will be the same kind of logic used to find the destination question after a choice has been selected.
